### About
The idea of this app came about after trying to successfully manage multiple projects and goals in my personal life. Most applications are focused on more enterprise scale use case scenarious such as managing multiple teams and workflows, and not necessarily focused on the individual. 

How much time will it take one person who is working on multiple side projects, taking different classes to further their skills, and also wanted to schedule in daily routines to come up with a daily to do list that prioritizes everything that they have on their plate. Even longer if they take into account deadlines for said projects, tasks, and goals. 

What if there was an app that could help you manage all of these ideas going on at once, giving you a simple todo list everyday organized by priority to help you achieve all of the goals you are working towards? An app that could track time spent per goal, and subtask, and intelligently create your to-do list everyday, and even give tips and reminders about productivity. 

That is the idea behind this to-do app.
